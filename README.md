# Technical Information
The following is a basic reference for some of the techincal stuff in the project that I'd like to keep track of.

### CI/CD Workflow
The workflow has been set-up and shouldn't require any special attention or changes. The build is automatically sent to my Raspberry Pi, functioning as an onsite backup. The git repo is mirrored to my offline repo every 15 minutes.

#### CI/CD Support
This template has support for tests and CI/CD integration.
- **To add tests**: Add tests to `tests/unit` or `tests/integration`. Only filenames starting with `test_` get tested!
- **To build project:** When `master` gets a commit or a PR, the CI will automatically build the project using the Godot-CLI for `Windows`, `Mac`, `Linux` and `WebGL`!

#### Optional modifications to CI/CD
* Modify `.pre-commit-config.yml` and comment out pre-commit hooks you don't want to run.
* Modify `.gutconfig.json` to change how gut runs.
* Modify the `GODOT_VERSION` env_var in `.gut.sh` to match your preferred version of Godot.
* Modify the build status images at the top of this README to point to your build status instead of the template's
